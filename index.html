			<h2> About Me </h2> 
			<img src="#" alt="Picture of Vatsal"> <!-- insert image url--> 
			<p>
				My university education is in Mathematics (First Class BSc with Hons) after which I taught Mathematics at secondary schools. I now wish to get into coding, as I love the logic of programming and satisfaction that comes from problem-solving. I particularly enjoy spending
				time trying to figure out challenging problems and the satisfaction of making progress and finally arriving at a solution that works, as well as 
				thinking about if I could make the algorthms I use more efficient or write better and cleaner code.  
			</p>
			<p> 
				My previous experience in coding is an "Introduction to C++" course I did at university, and I had also read the "Learning Web Design" book by J.N. Robbins in an attempt to create a website for my driving instructor a few years ago. These first experiences in coding showed me that I do have a real interest in software development and that I wish to learn more. I also learned about the theory of Cryptography in my Mathematics degree and I am interested to learn how security is applied in real-life software applications. I marvel at how programming is so present in the modern world and in its multifarious applications to help society and I wish to help others by creating useful software. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I also love to play sports, meditate, and play classical guitar. I did
				a ski instructor course recently in New Zealand which was a lot of fun, and enjoyed the natural scenery of New Zealand.

			<h2> Why Founders and Coders? </h2>
			<div class="bubble">
				<p> 
					I enjoy writing code and I am driven to learn new programming skills. I enjoy learning skills independently and working with others.
				</p>
			</div> 
			<div class="bubble">
				<p>
					I have ideas of web-based applications I would like to create. One of these is an application to learn music theory on the guitar. Another is an education platform to learn university level Mathematics. Through Founders and Coders I can develop the skills I need to create my own applications.
				</p>
			</div> 
			<div class="bubble">
				<p>
					Founders and Coders gives me an opportunity to learn coding in a short time and to find out if it is something I would like to do as a professional vocation.
				</p>
			</div> 
			<div class="bubble">
				<p> 
					I enjoy working with others and the peer based learning philosophy. In my Mathematics degree I found discussing problems often helped to overcome obstacles in the problem-solving process and to look at the problem from a different perspective. 
				</p>
			</div> 
			<div class="bubble">
				<p>
					I enjoyed the positive community feel at the Monday evening meet-up sessions at Founders and Coders and there is a sense that everyone
					wants to help each other which is really lovely. 
				</p>
			</div> 
			<div class="bubble">
				<p>
					I would enjoy mentoring students and feel a part of the community through volunteering, particularly as I love teaching.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="bubble">
				<p> 
					I respect the non-profit philosophy behind Founders and Coders, and it takes away financial pressure and allows me to focus on the training.
